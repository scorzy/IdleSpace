# IdleSpace

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scorzy/IdleSpace.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scorzy/IdleSpace)

This is an idle game about space combat. I made it to try web workers and some Angular Matrial CDK, that's why there are drag and drop and per battle is handled per ship.
